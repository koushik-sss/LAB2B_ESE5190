# Sequencer controlling APDS9960
## It can be seen that the sequencer has been modified to control the APDS9960 into showing the color and proximity sensor readings

- Color sensor shows the R/G/B/C value on the Serial console
- Proximity sensor shows 0 if far away from sensor and 1 if close to APDS
